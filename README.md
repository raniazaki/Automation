# AutomatingSignUpProcess
This repo describes sign up process using automation testing. 
## by using Robot framework with python libraries I automate the signup page of "https://www.phptravels.net" 


1-test case will pass if first name starts with capital letter and first name not equal the last name.

2-test case will fail if irst name starts with small letter and first name equal to the last name.

3-all fields are mandatory to complete the signup process 


My Project files(Acceptance testing):
                 
                 
                 -testcases (Validlogin,invalidlogin,resources)
                 
                 -output.xml 
                 -report.html: report library is used to generate reports automatically with passed 
                and failed testcases and to explain the reason of each fail
               

##Prerequisit:
